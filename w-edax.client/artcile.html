    <h2>Understanding Cloud Security</h2>
    <h4>What is Cloud Security?</h4>
    <p>
      Cloud security encompasses the policies, controls, procedures, and
      technologies that work together to protect cloud-based systems, data, and
      infrastructure. It involves safeguarding against a range of threats
      including data breaches, unauthorized access, and denial-of-service
      attacks. Unlike traditional on-premises security, cloud security must
      address the unique aspects of cloud environments such as shared
      responsibility models, multi-tenancy, and dynamic scaling.
    </p>

    <h4>Shared Responsibility Model</h4>
    <p>
      A fundamental concept in cloud security is the Shared Responsibility
      Model. This model defines the security responsibilities of both the cloud
      service provider (CSP) and the customer. While the CSP manages the
      security of the cloud infrastructure, the customer is responsible for
      securing their applications, data, and operating systems within the cloud
      environment. Understanding this division of responsibility is crucial for
      implementing effective security measures.
